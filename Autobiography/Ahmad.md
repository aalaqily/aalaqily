<h2 align="center">Ahmad</h2>

- **Ahmad** is an Arabic name which means _"The well praised"_ or _"The man who praises god well"_ It comes from the verb _"حَمِدَ"_ _/ħamida/_ which means _"to praise"_
- **Ahmad** is one of the prophet **Muhammad**'s names _-peace be upon him-_, and it is the name in which he - ﷺ - was mentioned in bible's prophecy
- I was named **Ahmad** for my paternal grandfather & my maternal uncle _- رحمهما الله -_ and of course for our prohphet **Muhammad** - ﷺ - in the first place
- Actually we Egyptians love the prophet **Muhammad** - ﷺ -, so almost in every muslim home in Egypt you will find at least someone called **Ahmad** or **Muhammad**, & if you visited or will visit Egypt, you probably will hear a lot of people calls **Ahmad** & **Muhammad**, in the streets, in the malls, in the public gardens & everywhere, that's actually because half of the Egyptians are **Ahmad** & **Muhammad** -and I'm not exaggerating in my claim 🙂-

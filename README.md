- 👋 Hi, I’m @iAhmadGad
- 👀 I’m interested in Scratch & Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Github

# ☕ What I'm working on: 
- [Calculator.Java](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/Calculator.Java)

Currently I'm working to make a calculator with java, I'm still trying to develop it, & to figure out an algorithm that could make many math operations with more than than 2 numbers, considerating the operator precedence.

# 🪐 Other:
- [Whatever.Java](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/Whatever.Java): Some random codes made with Java.
- [PixelMan-Platformer-1.Scratch](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/PixelMan-Platformer-1.Scratch): A simple platformer game made with Scratch.
- [PixelMan-Platformer-2.Scratch](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/PixelMan-Platformer-2.Scratch): The second part from the previous game.

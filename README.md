- 👋🏼 Hi, I’m @iAhmadGad
- 🌚 I'm a 16 years old boy, who loves mathematics, physics, programming, and anyting related
- 👀 I’m interested in Scratch & Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Github
## ☕ What I'm working on: 
- [JCalculator `Latest: v0.4`](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/JCalculator)

Currently I'm developing a calculator with java, I'm still trying to figure out an algorithm that could solve many math operations with more than just 2 numbers, considering the operator precedence.
## 🪐 Other:
- [JavaRandoms](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/JavaRandoms): Some random codes made with Java.

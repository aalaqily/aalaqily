## ☕ What I'm working on
- [**JCalculator**](https://github.com/iAhmadGad/JCalculator) `Latest: v0.4`

Currently I'm developing a calculator with java, I'm still trying to figure out an algorithm that could solve many math operations with more than just 2 numbers, considering the operator precedence.
